## How It Works

Most operations in the Proofly API use an asynchronous job pattern:

1. **Submit a Request** - Send your request to the appropriate endpoint
2. **Receive Job ID** - Get a job ID for tracking the operation
3. **Poll for Status** - Check job status until completion
4. **Get Results** - Retrieve the final results when the job completes

This pattern allows us to handle complex operations that may take time to complete, such as profile searches and friend verifications.
